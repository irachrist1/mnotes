# MNotes — Vision

**February 2026 — Living Document**

---

## Principle Zero: Speed

Never compromise on speed. Not loading speed, not build speed, not shipping speed. Every decision is filtered through: does this make us faster or slower? If slower, it needs an extraordinary reason to exist.

- The app must feel instant. Sub-second interactions. No spinners where avoidable.
- We ship working features, not perfect abstractions. Build, learn, refine.
- If a choice is between "architecturally elegant but slow to ship" and "simple but ships today," we ship today.

## The Idea in One Sentence

MNotes is a personal AI that learns everything about your business and life, organizes it automatically, and helps you make better decisions — whether you drop in a file, type a thought, or just talk to it.

---

## 1. What MNotes Is

At its simplest, MNotes is a place to put things. Like Apple Notes. You open it, you write something, you close it. Done.

But underneath, an AI is reading what you wrote. It figures out that your note is about a new client, or an idea you had, or a reflection on a mentor call. It files it. It connects it to things you've said before. It updates your view. It remembers.

Over time, MNotes builds a living profile of you — your soul file. Your goals, your income streams, your ideas, your patterns, your preferences. Every interaction makes it smarter. And that profile powers everything: your personalized view, your briefings, your suggestions, and the context you carry to every other AI tool.

**The spectrum:**

```
Apple Notes ──────────────────────────────────────── Jarvis
simple storage                               autonomous agent
you organize                                   it organizes
you remember                                   it remembers
you decide                                     it advises
```

MNotes lives wherever you want on this spectrum. Start simple. It gets smarter as you use it.

## 2. Core Behaviors

### Chat With It

The chat is the product. Not a feature bolted on — the front door.

```
You:     "Just closed a $3k/month deal with Acme for consulting"
MNotes:  Created income stream: Acme Consulting, $3k/mo, active.
         This brings your total to $8.2k/mo — 82% toward your $10k goal.

You:     "I have an idea — what if I turned my consulting frameworks
          into a course?"
MNotes:  Based on your data:
         - Your consulting generates $5.2k/mo across 3 clients
         - You've mentioned "frameworks" in 4 mentor sessions
         - A course aligns with your goal to build passive income
         Want me to add this to your ideas pipeline?

You:     "How's my week looking?"
MNotes:  Revenue: $8.2k/mo (+12% from last month)
         2 overdue action items from Sarah's session
         Idea "AI Workshop" stuck in validating for 18 days
```

Everything you say becomes structured knowledge. The AI proposes, you confirm, it commits.

### Drop Anything In

Drag a file into the chat. Any file.

| You drop in... | MNotes does... |
|----------------|----------------|
| Mentor session notes (PDF/doc) | Extracts mentor name, topics, insights, action items. Proposes a mentorship session entry. |
| Bank statement (CSV/PDF) | Parses transactions. Matches to income streams, flags new sources. |
| Voice memo | Transcribes. Extracts structured data. Routes to correct place. |
| Screenshot of an idea | Reads image. Creates idea entry with description, tags, category. |
| Random note | Reads it, figures out what it is, proposes where it belongs. |

Always confirmation before writes. You stay in control.

### Your Soul File

Inspired by OpenClaw's SOUL.md — a living profile that captures who you are.

```markdown
# soul.md (auto-generated, always updating)

## Identity
Name: Christian
Role: Independent consultant & builder
Focus: AI consulting, product development

## Goals (active)
- Hit $10k/month recurring revenue by June 2026
- Launch first digital product (course) by Q3 2026
- Build mentorship network of 10+ regular contacts

## Income Profile
- 3 active streams, $8.2k/mo total
- Primary: consulting (63%), employment (25%), content (12%)
- Avg growth: +8.3%/mo

## Patterns (learned)
- Logs mentorship sessions on Thursdays
- Most productive ideation happens late evening
- Prefers direct communication style
- Reviews finances on Monday mornings

## Notes
(free-form section the AI updates as it learns more about you)
```

This file isn't something you write. MNotes writes it. The structured base (name, goals) comes from onboarding. The rest — patterns, notes, connections — the AI discovers and records over time. The soul file powers everything: chat context, briefings, suggestions, and the context you export to other tools.

### Proactive Briefings and Nudges

Jarvis reaches out when something matters. You don't have to ask.

- **Morning briefing:** Revenue status, overdue items, stale ideas, goal progress. Delivered as a notification.
- **Smart nudges:** Revenue dropped? Idea stuck for 2 weeks? Action item overdue? Jarvis pings you.
- **Configurable:** Set your briefing time, nudge frequency, quiet hours.

### Context You Can Carry Anywhere

Your organized MNotes data is available as context to any AI tool via API.

- Use ChatGPT? MNotes feeds it your business context.
- Use Cursor? MNotes feeds it your project goals and idea pipeline.
- Use Claude? MNotes feeds it your mentor session history.

MNotes doesn't compete with other AI tools. It makes them all better by giving them structured context about you.

## 3. What Exists Today

| Layer | What's Built |
|-------|-------------|
| Auth | Email/password via Convex Auth, working sign-in, protected routes |
| Backend | Convex: income streams, ideas, mentorship sessions, AI insights, user settings — full CRUD **plus** `soulFiles`, `chatThreads`, and `chatMessages` tables with indexes |
| AI | OpenRouter + Google AI pipeline with user-configurable models in Settings; platform OpenRouter key for onboarding (default `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`); schema-driven intents (no hardcoded intent types); soul file background evolution (auto-runs every 5 chat messages); vector + lexical dedup on saved insights |
| Frontend | 7 dashboard pages, analytics, charts, responsive layout, Sidebar, CommandPalette (Cmd+K), floating chat panel on all dashboard pages, full-screen conversational onboarding that generates the initial soul file |
| Chat | Multi-thread conversations, intent detection + ConfirmationCard for AI-proposed data mutations, LazyMarkdownMessage rendering, optimistic UI, scroll pinning |
| Crons | Daily cleanup for expired insights and prompt cache |

**What does not exist yet:** File ingestion (drag/drop, OCR, classification), proactive behavior (weekly digests/briefings/nudges), context API/MCP integration, native mobile app, persistent assistant avatar/identity across the UI, onboarding API key setup, chat-first empty-dashboard experience.

---

## 4. Build Plan

Four milestones. Each ships something a user can touch. Each one makes the next more powerful.

### Milestone 1: Soul + Chat (the embryo)

**Status: the core of this milestone is live.**

MNotes is now something you can talk to. The assistant learns who you are via a conversational onboarding chat, generates a soul file, and lives in a floating chat panel across the dashboard.

- Soul file table + conversational onboarding chat that collects name/role/goals and generates an initial soul file markdown via OpenRouter (platform key, default Gemini 3 Flash)
- Persistent chat interface (ChatPanel + ConfirmationCard + ChatButton) — AI proposes structured intents, UI confirms, Convex mutations commit to domain tables (`incomeStreams`, `ideas`, `mentorshipSessions`)
- Intents are **schema-driven**, not hardcoded: a prompt-level description of writable tables/fields guides the AI to emit `{ table, operation, data }` intents instead of relying on fixed enums
- Model selection wired in Settings; main chat uses the user’s chosen model, onboarding uses the platform key/model
- Chat is available from all dashboard pages via a floating button

**Completed since initial build:**
- Soul file background evolution from regular chat messages (auto-runs every 5 user messages via `ctx.scheduler.runAfter`)
- Multiple chat threads per user (thread list, "New chat" button, thread switching)
- Vector + lexical deduplication on saved insights
- CommandPalette (Cmd+K) with cross-entity search

**V1 launch checklist (remaining for Milestone 1):**

1. **API key setup in onboarding** — After soul file confirmation, show a setup step for provider + model + API key (with skip option). Eliminates the dead-AI cliff where users land on a dashboard with no working AI because they haven't discovered Settings. Implementation: phase state machine in `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` (`"chat" | "setup" | "complete"`), shared model constants in `src/lib/aiModels.ts`.

2. **Chat-first post-onboarding landing** — When a freshly onboarded user arrives at the dashboard with zero domain data, auto-open the chat panel and show suggested prompt chips ("I just closed a deal", "I have a new idea", "Log a mentor session"). Implementation: `convex/dashboard.ts` `isEmpty` query (three indexed `.first()` lookups), `initialChatOpen` prop passed from `client-layout.tsx` → `DashboardShell`, suggestion chips in `ChatPanel` empty state.

3. **Weekly AI digest** — Convex cron (Sunday 8:00 UTC) generates a personalized digest per user using their own API key. Covers revenue summary, stalled ideas, mentorship status, goal progress from soul file. Saved as high-priority `aiInsight` with type `"weekly-digest"`. Shown as a prominent card on the dashboard home page. Implementation: `convex/ai/weeklyDigest.ts` (`runAll` + `generateForUser` internal actions), `aiInsights.createDigestInternal` mutation, `aiInsights.getUnreadDigests` query.

- Fully deprecate the standalone AI Insights page once briefings/nudges replace it (deferred to after V1)

**You get:** An assistant you can talk to that knows who you are, can write directly into your income/ideas/mentorship data, guides you from onboarding to first value without friction, and proactively reaches out weekly with business insights.

### Milestone 2: Files + Proactive (Jarvis starts working for you)

MNotes accepts anything and reaches out when it matters.

- File drop in chat — upload, AI classifies/extracts, confirmation card, commit
- Cron jobs: morning briefing, nudge engine
- Notification center (in-app first, push later)
- User profile: timezone, briefing time, nudge preferences

**You get:** Drop a bank statement and it becomes structured data. Wake up to a briefing you didn't ask for.

### Milestone 3: Memory + Context API (Jarvis becomes portable)

MNotes remembers everything and shares context with your other tools.

- Vector embeddings on all content, semantic search
- Chat falls back to semantic search for "What did Sarah say about pricing?"
- Context API endpoints: soul, summary, search
- API key management in settings
- MCP-native server so Claude/Cursor/ChatGPT can pull your context directly

**You get:** Ask anything about your history. Carry your context into every AI tool you use.

### Milestone 4: Mobile App (Jarvis goes with you)

Chat-first native app. Same Convex backend.

- Expo (React Native) app: Chat tab, Home tab, Notifications tab, Profile tab
- Native push notifications
- Camera for document capture
- Voice input
- Share extension ("Share to MNotes" from any app)

**You get:** Jarvis in your pocket.

## 5. What Makes This Different

| Other tools | MNotes |
|------------|--------|
| You organize your data | AI organizes it for you |
| Forms and structured input | Chat, voice, file drop — any format |
| Siloed app | Your context flows to every AI tool you use |
| You visit it when you remember | It reaches out when something matters |
| Same interface for everyone | Personalized around your soul file |
| Tool you use | Assistant that knows you |

**The soul file is the moat.** The more you use MNotes, the more it knows. The more it knows, the more useful it becomes. The more useful it becomes, the more you use it. Flywheel.

---

## 6. Analytics & Usage Tracking (PostHog)

**Status: planned — not yet implemented.**

PostHog will be the single analytics layer. Every event keyed by `userId` from Convex auth. Client-side SDK for page views + UI interactions, server-side (Convex actions) for AI token tracking.

### Onboarding Funnel (are people finishing setup?)
- `sign_up` → `onboarding_started` → `soul_file_created` → `api_key_configured` → `onboarding_completed` / `onboarding_skipped`
- Drop-off between each step is the #1 metric to watch during beta.

### Core Engagement (are they coming back?)
- `page_viewed` (per route: dashboard, income, ideas, mentorship, ai-insights, analytics, settings)
- `chat_panel_opened`, `chat_message_sent`, `command_palette_opened`, `sidebar_toggled`
- `income_stream_created/updated/deleted`, `idea_created/updated/stage_changed`, `session_created`
- `suggestion_chip_clicked` (which prompts do new users pick?)

### AI Value (is the AI actually useful?)
- `chat_ai_response` (with `tokenCount`, `model`, `provider`, `cacheHit`)
- `intent_proposed` → `intent_confirmed` vs `intent_rejected` (intent accuracy rate)
- `soul_file_evolved` (how often does the profile update?)
- `weekly_digest_generated`, `weekly_digest_dismissed` (do people read digests?)
- `insight_saved` vs `insight_removed` (are generated insights worth keeping?)
- `saved_insight_pinned`, `saved_insight_accessed` (re-use rate)

### Token Economics (what's it costing per user?)
- Track per AI operation: `chat_send`, `soul_file_evolution`, `weekly_digest`, `onboarding_chat`, `manual_analysis`, `insight_embedding`
- Properties: `tokensUsed`, `aiProvider`, `aiModel`, `cacheHit`, `durationMs`
- Goal: know cost-per-user-per-week to price sustainably.

### Implementation Plan
1. Add `posthog-js` to client, initialize in `ConvexClientProvider` with `userId` as distinct ID
2. Auto-capture page views via Next.js router events
3. Add `posthog.capture()` calls to key UI actions (chat open, message send, intent confirm/reject, chip click, digest dismiss)
4. For server-side AI token tracking: log events from Convex actions via PostHog server API (`fetch` to `https://us.i.posthog.com/capture/`)
5. Build PostHog dashboards: onboarding funnel, daily active users, AI cost per user, intent accuracy

---

## 7. What We Explicitly Defer


- Calendar/Gmail/Notion/Plaid sync (v2 — after core assistant is proven)
- Autonomous external actions (no sending emails or creating events for you — yet)
- Voice output / TTS
- Multi-user workspaces
- Fully automated adaptive dashboard reordering (manual controls first)

---

## 8. Success Looks Like

Six months from now, a user describes MNotes to a friend:

> "It's like if Apple Notes, my accountant, and a really good assistant had a baby. I just dump stuff into it — notes, files, voice memos, whatever — and it figures out where everything goes. It knows my goals, tracks my money, reminds me about things I forgot. I talk to it like a person and it just... handles things."

That's the product.
