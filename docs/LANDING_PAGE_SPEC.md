## Copywriting Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Direct:** No fluff. Say what it does.
- **Personal:** Use "you" and "your" frequently
- **Confident:** We're building something valuable
- **Honest:** It's early stage — own that authentically

### Words to Use
- Context, intelligence, insights, clarity
- Capture, track, understand, grow
- Personal, yours, you
- Finally, actually, real

### Words to Avoid
- Revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive
- Synergy, leverage, optimize (overused)
- "We're excited to announce" (corporate speak)
- Fake social proof or user counts

### Headline Formula
**[Benefit] + [Differentiator]**
- "Finally, an AI That Actually Knows You"
- "Your Ideas Deserve Better Than a Notes App"
- "Stop Explaining Your Life to AI"

---

## Conversion Elements

### Primary CTA: "Join the Waitlist"
- Appears in: Hero, sticky nav, section 10, final CTA

- Size: Large, impossible to miss

### Secondary CTAs

- "View Roadmap" → Scroll to roadmap
- "Follow the Journey" → External link to Twitter/blog

### Trust Builders

- "Building in public"
- Tech stack badges (Supabase, Gemini)

### Urgency (Honest)
- "Early access spots are limited"
